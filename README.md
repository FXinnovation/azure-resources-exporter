# azure-resources-exporter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FXinnovation/azure-resources-exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FXinnovation/azure-resources-exporter)

**Warning, this exporter is still a work in progress**

Prometheus exporter exposing Azure resources API results as metrics.

This exporter does not export metrics from Azure Monitor API, use [azure_metrics_exporter](https://github.com/RobustPerception/azure_metrics_exporter) for that.

## Getting Started

### Azure account requirements

This exporter call Azure API from an existing subscription with these requirements:

* An application must be registered (e.g., Azure Active Directory -> App registrations -> New application registration)

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need a [working Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Installing

```bash
go get -u github.com/FXinnovation/azure-resources-exporter
```

## Building

Build the sources with

```bash
make build
```

## Run the binary

```bash
./azure-resources-exporter
```

The exporter expects these environment variables to configure the Azure API
connection.

Environment Variable | Description
---------------------| -----------
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Found under properties in the Azure portal for your application/service
AZURE_TENANT_ID | Found under `Azure Active Directory > Properties` and listed as `Directory ID`
AZURE_CLIENT_ID | Also listed as `Application Id`, is obtained by registering an application under 'Azure Active Directory'
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET | Is generated by selecting your application/service under Azure Active Directory, selecting 'keys', and generating a new key

By default, the exporter optional config file is expected in `config/config.yml`.

Use -h flag to list available options.

## Testing

### Running unit tests

```bash
make test
```

## Configuration

No configuration is supported yet in `config/config.yml` (**WIP**)

## Docker image

You can build a docker image using:

```bash
make docker
```

The resulting image is named `fxinnovation/azure-resources-exporter:<git-branch>`. 
It exposes port 9259 and expects an optional config in `/opt/azure-resources-exporter/config.yml`. 
To configure it, you must pass the envionment variable, and you can bind-mount a config from your host:

```bash
docker run -p 9259:9259 -v /path/on/host/config/config.yml:/opt/azure-resources-exporter/config/config.yml -e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="my_subscription_id" -e AZURE_TENANT_ID="my_tenant_id" -e AZURE_CLIENT_ID="my_client_id" -e AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="my_client_secret" fxinnovation/azure-resources-exporter:<git-branch>
```

## Exposed metrics

Metric | Description
------ | -----------
virtual_machine_instance_up | Running status of the virtual machine instance
virtual_network_gateway_connection_up | Connections status of the virtual network gateway
